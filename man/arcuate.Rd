\description{
This data contains a sample of measurements from dMRI patients. dMRI measures
the flow of water through the brain. After the image is processed, a
trajectory tracking algorithm is applied to determine the direction of
water diffusion. This leads to a collection of fasicles that connect different
regions of the brain to each other. This data is for the fasicles that
correspond to the Arcuate fascilicus shown below (Source: \href{https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arcuate_Fasciculus.jpg}{Wikipedia}).

This data contains two measurements:
\enumerate{
\item The \code{position} along the region, from one end to the other.
\item The \code{fa} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_anisotropy}{"fractional anisotropy"}
a measurement of the amount of diffusivity.
